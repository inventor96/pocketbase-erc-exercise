# Copilot Instructions
This project is a web application that aids in simulating an emergency response scenario for communicators of the Emergency Response Communications (ERC) group of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The application is designed to help communicators practice their skills in a controlled environment, allowing them to gain experience and confidence in their roles. The application has a pre-defined list of "items", configured by admin users. When the exercise/simulation is active/started, participants indicate they're ready to receive assignments. The application then randomly assigns items to pairs of participants, with one participant being the "need" user who is supposed to find the item among the other participants, and the other participant being the "resource" user who has the item. It is then up to the participants of the exercise to practice their skills in finding the item and communicating with each other. The application also includes a dashboard/monitor for admins to view the status of the exercise, as well as a report feature to generate a summary of the exercise for review, analysis, and awards. The application is build with Pocketbase v0.18.10 on the backend, using JavaScript for extending the functionality; and HTML, Bootstrap 5.3, jQuery, and the Pocketbase JS SDK for the frontend. There is some SSR (server-side rendering) to allow for a common header, footer, script link, and Pocketbase client instance across all pages.

## Coding Standards
- Use camelCase for variable and function names.
- Use single quotes for strings unless the string contains a single quote, in which case use double quotes.
- Strings with variable interpolation should use template literals (backticks).
- Use tabs for indentation.
